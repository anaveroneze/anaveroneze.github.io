# Personal

Besides work, I enjoy reading self-development and dystopian books (favorite is Brave New World), watching movies ([podcast ep.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0U3Etjb1JtpbvyEd84UTBk?si=7f97abf0a76f4f97) on one of my favorite movies), and exercising (indoor cycling, swimming, or running). Practicing yoga since 2020 helps me to start my mornings. Drawing is my tool for creativity. I listen to music wherever I go and going to concerts is my favorite hobby ([playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6LzNBaB0ntsGb2hQvH674o?si=369c089afcc147b5) with bands I saw since I moved to the USA).

I enjoy writting about [experiences](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze/list/experiences-3511152bb949), [travel itineraries](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze/list/travel-e29da5b7d070) (well curated by a Virgo), and pt-br learnings from being a [grad student](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze/list/posgraduacao-f61b957b08b9). I use [Medium](https://medium.com/@anaveroneze) and have published at [Revelo](https://community.revelo.com.br/author/anaveroneze/). 

I speak Portuguese (native), English (inevitable), Spanish (by osmosis from my Peruvian dad), and some French (in-progress).
